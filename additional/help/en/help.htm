<h2>Settings</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image1.png"></p>
<p>System settings</p>
<p>"Socket port". At the first start, the program reserves the specified port.When you restart, the port is checked and prevents the second copy of the program from running. Another use is to run the task from the command line.  </p>
<p>"Show window with action buttons" - The program has a regular window with buttons of main actions. When the check box is selected, the window will be displayed.  </p>
<p>"Show in system tray". If the check box is not selected, a window with action buttons is displayed.  </p>
<p>"Show notification after task with error". If the check box is not selected, windows with notifications is not displayed. However, you can view the records in the 'Alerts and Errors'  </p>
<p>"Default timeout for notification (sec)". If the value is not set, windows with notifications is not closed.  </p>
<p>Clipboard settings</p>
<p>"Number of items on page".  </p>
<p>"Maximum text size"  </p>
<p>"Remove duplicates items". If you delete duplicates, you may lose information about the time of creation and source of the clips.  </p>
<p>"Timeout for save position (sec)".  To easily select several consecutive clips, the previous position is saved when the list is opened. Later
specified time - the list of clips opens, starting with the most recent.  </p>
<p>"Separator of clip texts when selecting multiple clips in the clip list". If you select multiple clips in the list, you can get them in one string. Each clip will be separated from the other by the specified text.  </p>
<p>"Watch the clipboard: primary (mouse selection)".  Only Linux. </p>
<p><a name=Clp></a></p>
<h2>Clips list</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image2.png"></p>
<p>A list of clips showing the copy time, title, and class of the owner window is displayed. For Linux system additionally shown
clipboard: normal or selection. When you select a clip, the current position is stored. When you reopen the list, the cursor is placed on the previous clip. The cursor position is reset after the time has elapsed, specified in the settings.  </p>
<p><a name=Gr></a></p>
<h2>Tasks groups</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image3.png"></p>
<p>Tasks can be grouped together. When you open a task group, you can view/run tasks only from the specified group. You can specify hotkeys for a group. When you enter these keys, a list of tasks opens with selection for the selected group.  </p>
<p><a name=Tsk></a></p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image4.png"></p>
<p>You can perform actions on rows retrieved from the clipboard or
selected in a text editor. Each task consists of a list
subtasks executed sequentially.</p>
<p>Data exchange between subtasks is carried out using a special
a dictionary repository where you can place text content by specifying
any code and also get back. If the dictionary code is empty -- we are working
with the current row being processed.</p>
<p>It should be taken into account that there are two special subtasks:
copy to the clipboard and paste from the clipboard. Despite the indication
keyboard shortcuts, these subtasks are special. In some cases (e.g.
when working with an RDP server) updating the clipboard may take
for a long time and you cannot use just simulating keystrokes.
You must wait for the actual buffer update.</p>

<h2>Filter for foreground window</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image5.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image6.png"></p>
<p>The task can only be performed in the specified window or screen item.
You can specify in regular expression format a allowed or denied character combination in a window header or class. You can, for example, use a filter to avoid copying saved clips to the list passwords.  </p>
<p><a name=Aler></a></p>
<h2>Alerts and errors</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="md_media/image7.png"></p>
<p>This is a separate table that automatically gets errors when performing tasks. In addition, you can write text there yourself so that
then analyze.</p>
